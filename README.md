## Overview

This repository features:

- **Solidity Tutorials**: Examples and exercises for learning how to write smart contracts in Solidity.
- **Smart Contract Projects**: Practical implementations and projects demonstrating real-world applications.
- **Blockchain Theory**: Fundamental concepts and principles of blockchain technology.

The materials aim to help me and others gain a solid understanding of both the theory and practical aspects of blockchain development.

## Repository Structure

Here’s how the repository is organized:

- `lectures/` – Notes and explanations from Web3Bridge lectures and tutorials.
- `contracts/` – Solidity smart contract examples and coding exercises.
- `coursework/` – Projects and assignments from my learning journey.
- `docs/` – Additional resources, guides, and documentation.
- `scripts/` – Deployment and utility scripts for smart contracts.

## Getting Started

To start exploring the materials in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web3bridge-solidity-learning.git
   cd web3bridge-solidity-learning
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Development Tools**:
   This repository uses [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) and [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/). Install them as follows:

   - **Foundry**:
     Follow the installation instructions from the Foundry [documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/). Typically, you would install it with:
     ```bash
     curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
     foundryup
     ```

   - **Hardhat**:
     Install Hardhat using npm:
     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev hardhat
     ```

4. **Compile Contracts**:
   Use Foundry or Hardhat to compile the smart contracts:
   - For Foundry:
     ```bash
     forge build
     ```
   - For Hardhat:
     ```bash
     npx hardhat compile
     ```

5. **Deploy Contracts**:
   Follow the deployment scripts in the `scripts/` directory to deploy contracts:
   - For Foundry:
     Write and execute deployment scripts using Foundry’s tools.
   - For Hardhat:
     ```bash
     npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
     ```

## Usage

### Running Tests

To test the smart contracts and code:

- For Foundry:
  ```bash
  forge test
  ```

- For Hardhat:
  ```bash
  npx hardhat test
  ```

### Running Scripts

To deploy and interact with smart contracts:

- For Foundry:
  Execute deployment and interaction scripts using Foundry's tooling.
  
- For Hardhat:
  ```bash
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
  ```
